# Tindog

## An app for adopting dogs that has the tinder mechanism

### One of my biggest driving forces to becoming a great developer is the promise I made for myself that when I become a senior developer, I will adopt my first dog

### I decided to develop an App to keep me driven towards that goal using

- React Hooks
- React Router
- Vanilla JS Array Methods

#### Hosting this site on GH pages introduced a bug with React Router: Once the page opens since the URL ends with /Tindog it is not loading the / page. This can be bypassed by clicking the paw to go to / but that means that the rest of the Routing won't work. I'm guessing that this will be an easy fix by Adding /Tindog to all my routes but I want to make more research before I attempt that! Til then run it locally! Thank you :)
